                Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu for Sunday dinner. Sundays have been a perfect opportunity for me to experiment with new dessert recipes, especially those that serve tons of people, since we have help polishing it all off and don't have it sitting around the house, tempting us for days.

                I have long associated the German Chocolate Cake with Father's Day, although I'm not entirely sure why. I think I remember my mom making it for my dad once or twice growing up (although never on Father's Day, ironically) and the correlation must have stuck somewhere along the way.
